Arduino on breadboard with 32.768 KHz crystal

CKSEL[3:0] = 0010 (Use internal RC oscillator as the clock)
This should be set by the "Arduino on Breadboard" board model.

C_e = 2(12.5) - 6 = 19 pF external capacitors required when using crystal as timer oscillator
(Can try 22 or 15.)

Arduino as ISP -- need to use adafruit's fork and connect pin 9 to pin 9 to provide a clock signal

Slide detection: Just using this to detect movement out of the OFF position, the comparator
threshold may need to be adjusted if the stop size is adjusted significantly. 50 mV seems like a
reasonable starting point. Except that the bottom of the slide isn't really zero, at least on the
pot side that I fried. The other one actually looks OK. It will be nicer to have a larger "OFF"
area anyway so it's harder to turn it on by accident, so I will make that stop larger. And this
threshold needs to actually be something that registers as a stop so you can't end up in an "ON"
state that just drains the battery. You need to know it's on if it's using power. The circuit is a
voltage divider, so the threshold is a percentage of the input voltage. The first stop (where the
buzzer goes off) is currently at 3% of the total voltage, so that's what the voltage divider will
do. So this DEFINITELY needs to be adjusted if the stops are changed.

How to fix it:
- Stops at fixed intervals, except OFF and ZERO, which should be further apart (wider). This means
  division to figure out which stop we're at instead of binary search
- Treat the value coming from the ADC as having some precision (e.g. +/- 2), only do something if
  it changes by more than the precision
- Each stop should have a "size" for the purpose of positioning the slider. Once the slider gets
  within that range once (currentStop == nextStop), don't move it any more unless it actually goes
  to a different stop (either from the stopwatch or because the user moved it)
- Be explicit about the mode we're in, possibly based on what interrupt woke us up
  - For the timer, just see if it's time to move to the next stop
  - For the ADC, just do the position handling (differently when currentStop == nextStop, as above)

TODO:
- Slide detection too unreliable
- Draw schematic
- Check timing accuracy
- Make buzzer less awful
- Random beeps when moving slider?
