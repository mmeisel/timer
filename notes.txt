Arduino on breadboard with 32.768 KHz crystal

CKSEL[3:0] = 0010 (Use internal RC oscillator as the clock)
This should be set by the "Arduino on Breadboard" board model.

C_e = 2(12.5) - 6 = 19 pF external capacitors required when using crystal as timer oscillator
(Can try 22 or 15.)

Arduino as ISP -- need to use adafruit's fork and connect pin 9 to pin 9 to provide a clock signal

Slide detection: Just using this to detect movement out of the OFF position, the comparator
threshold may need to be adjusted if the stop size is adjusted significantly. 50 mV seems like a
reasonable starting point.

TODO:
- Slide detection too unreliable
- Draw schematic
- Check timing accuracy
- Make buzzer less awful
- Random beeps when moving slider?
