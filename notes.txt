Arduino on breadboard with 32.768 KHz crystal

CKSEL[3:0] = 0010 (Use internal RC oscillator as the clock)
This should be set by the "Arduino on Breadboard" board model.

C_e = 2(12.5) - 6 = 19 pF external capacitors required when using crystal as timer oscillator
(Can try 22 or 15.)

TODO:
- Slide detection too unreliable
- Draw schematic
- Check timing accuracy
- Make buzzer less awful
